cd call_notes_app
python app.py
```

The app opens with three tabs: Live Transcription, Notes Retrieval, and Customer Research.

---

## Tab 1: Live Transcription — Detailed Usage

1. Enter the customer name
2. Select audio devices (System Audio = CABLE Output, Microphone = your mic)

5. Click **📨 Outlook Draft** to create the email in your Outlook Drafts folder (with your signature)
6. Click **📋 Copy Transcript** to copy the raw transcript

## AI Q&A Agent

Detects AWS-related questions during calls and answers them by searching live AWS documentation.

### Three Modes (automatic fallback)

1. **AgentCore Runtime** — deployed agent via WebSocket + SigV4 auth
2. **Local MCP** — in-process agent with MCP doc search tools
3. **Direct Bedrock** — simple Claude call without tools

See [`agentcore_agent/README.md`](agentcore_agent/README.md) for deployment instructions.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| No transcript appearing | Check Windows output is set to CABLE Input; verify device selection |
| Bedrock `AccessDeniedException` | Verify Claude models in Bedrock console; check IAM permissions |
| Transcribe `InvalidClientTokenId` | Re-run `aws configure` with valid credentials |
| Outlook draft fails | Ensure Outlook desktop app is running; install `pywin32` |
| DynamoDB `ResourceNotFoundException` | No longer applicable — data is stored locally in SQLite |
| Customer brief stuck on "Researching" | Normal — Claude research takes 30-60s; watch the animated progress |
| Style guide empty | Run `python build_style_guide.py` with Outlook open and sent emails available |
| App doesn't capture mic audio | Select correct mic in dropdown; both streams are mixed |
| Outlook tasks not in To Do | Tasks appear under "Tasks" list in To Do sidebar; check "Call Notes" category |
| Weekly digest not sending | Verify Task Scheduler task "CallNotes-WeeklyDigest" is enabled; Outlook must be running |
| No competitors in Insights | Run `python backfill_insights.py` to populate from historical notes |
